# üöÄ Welcome to Your React Project!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is your launchpad for building an amazing React app! üéâ

## üìÇ Project Structure & Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run various commands to streamline your development workflow:

### üåê `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode! Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in your browser. The page refreshes on file saves, so you‚Äôll see your changes instantly. 

üõ† **Hot Tip:** Watch for linting errors in the console to keep your code clean!

### ‚úÖ `npm test`

Launches the interactive test runner. Run tests as you code to make sure everything‚Äôs working smoothly! üí™

üìñ **More Details**: Check out [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for in-depth information.

### üì¶ `npm run build`

Builds your app for production to the `build` folder. This command:
- Optimizes the React build for the best performance üöÄ
- Minifies files and includes hashes in filenames for better cache management ‚öôÔ∏è

Your app will be ready for deployment! üåê

üîó **Deployment Guide**: Visit [Deployment Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) to learn about different deployment strategies.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è `npm run eject`

> **Note**: This is a one-way operation! Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back.

If you need full control over your project‚Äôs configuration (like Webpack, Babel, etc.), `eject` will let you do it. Proceed only if necessary!
